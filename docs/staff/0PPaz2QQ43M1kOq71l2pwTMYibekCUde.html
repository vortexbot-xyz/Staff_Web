    <h1>Vortex Staff Documentation</h1>
    <h3>Please ensure you have read this information thoroughly as we will not accept any misconduct from staff members.</h3>
    <h2>This documentation is private & confidential information. Do not share it to community members without approval from Senior Developers+</h2>
    <h4>1. Staff activity</h4>
    <p>As a staff member, you are expected to meet a set quota every single week (every 7 days). You can find this quota listed below:</p>
    <code>1. You must complete a minimum of 3 tickets<br>2. You must reach a total of 200 messages per week (excluding #public-support)<br>3. You must have a minimum of 50 messages inside of #public-support</code>
    <br>
    <h4>2. Professionalism</h4>
    <p>Whilst within a staff position, you are expected to be professional when handling tickets, #public-support enquires or anything of similiarity. When talking within #staff-chat or #general you are not required to use grammar as long as when handling a situation you remain professional. We are not overly-strict on this rule as we would like a enjoyable experience as being a staff member whilst also remaining professional to ensure the expectations remain high from community members.</p>
    <br>
    <h4>3. Chain of Command</h4>
    <p>You must anyways ensure that you refer people to the correct teams, do not directly ping @primxjxke.js because he's online. Go through other ranks first.</p>
    <code>[ DEVELOPERS ]: Last place of contact. Do not contact developers (especially senior developer+) unless it is regarding something only we can handle. <br>[ COMMUNITY MANAGER ]: Community managers handle the staff team & manage giveaways, events & translation concerns. They will not handle anything that is not something you as support or moderation can handle. <br>[ SENIOR MODERATORS ]: Senior moderation members usually only handle major reports, or community reports. They will assist with moderation additonally but will not be the first place of contact regarding community member reports. <br>[ MODERATORS ]: Moderators usually handle with support team reports, they additonally handle community moderation concerns. <br>[ SENIOR SUPPORT ]: They are the second rank you obtain after joining the community staff team, they usually have more knowlage regarding the community & will directly handle anything that a support member cannot deal with. <br>[ SUPPORT ]: This is the first rank you obtain after joining our staff team, you'll be monitored closely & expected to handle concerns directly. <br> [ TRIAL SUPPORT ]: This rank is not an official staff-team rank, they are on trial & are expected to handle anything they are able to.</code>
    <br>
    <h4>4. Command Permissions</h4>
    <p>The staff team within vortex have a private moderation & utilities bot available to anyone above the rank of Trial Support team. This bot has open commands to anyone that is Trial Support+ meaning you can use >ban as a support team member. Please read our command restrictions below as we do not encourage using commands without permission.</p>
    <code>** If a command is not listed here, it is most likely allowed to be used by Trial Support+. <br><br>>modlogs - Trial Support+<br>>voidcase - Support+<br>>resetmodlogs - Senior Moderators+<br>>warn - Trial Support+<br>>mute - Support+<br>>kick - Moderators+<br>>ban - Senior Moderators++<br></code>
